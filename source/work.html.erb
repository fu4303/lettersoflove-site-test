        <h4>Handwritten letters</h4>
        <p>A handwritten letter brings an old-school charm like no other form of communication. This tangible token of love is us, extending a hand in friendship to the millions of refugee children who need our support; to let them know that they are not forgotten but are loved and cared for.</p>

        <p>The Pen Pal Project for children and youth aims at fostering friendships across lines of conflict. We connect school students with internally displaced children in Syria, those beseiged in Gaza and Syrian refugee children in Turkey. It gives them the opportunity to perceive people of other countries beyond</p>
