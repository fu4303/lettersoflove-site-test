      <h4>Through Letters of Love's #ItsChildrensDay campaign, over 2000 refugee children living in Turkey received letters from people living in different parts of the world on 23 April which is celebrated as The National Sovereignty and Childrenâ€™s Day in Turkey. Thanks to UNHCR Turkey and its partners for making these beautiful children smile.</h4>
