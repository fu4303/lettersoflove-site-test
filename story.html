    <p>OUR STORY
A 23-year old Mechanical Engineer turned High School Science teacher in 2015, Pooja, felt deeply disturbed by the updates of the Syrian War and Refugee Crisis in her newsfeed, sometimes watching live-streamed destruction of civilian neighbourhoods caused by barrel bombs, and merely watching it at the comfort of her home. She decided to do something about it!

This is her story. This is our story!

“When one person dies, it’s a tragedy. When a thousand die, it’s a statistic!’. This quote I read somewhere online flooded my head while I was flinching with what I had just seen- the image of the lifeless body of a 3 year old Alan Kurdi, washed ashore on an island in Greece. International media was outraged. While blaming countries, terrorism and governments, “Humanity has failed”, asserted most of the popular headlines. But what I saw in that mortifying picture was a symbol of what is wrong with the world today - we standby and watch war- its consequences and its casualties. There’s an inertia of apathy and that, is gut-wrenching.
Upon research, I learnt that there are 68.5 million displaced people around the world, around 24 million of them are children. The staggering number makes this disadvantaged population seem unreachable, unimaginable and untouchable.
We often forget that this statistic is made up of people - those like you & I - those who love to laugh, sing, travel, play- fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, sons, daughters - with their admirable, unique and human characteristics- who are at the centre of the conflict.

“But what difference can I make” was a question I had a trouble answering.

I’m not a political leader, I’m not rich, I’m not influential, I don’t have the resources. I assumed that these hurdles of mine echoed with that of many around the world, wanting to do something about it all. It’s not that people around me didn’t want to do anything about it. It was because they didn’t know how to do anything at all in their capacity. Ergo, they involuntarily became mute spectators to the grueling reality. Numbness was thrust upon us and we succumbed to it because we could afford to.

I soon came across Leo Buscaglia inspiring words - ‘Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around.’
I decided to do whatever I can, with whatever I have, wherever I was.
I decided to write a letter.
I pinged a few of my friends who shared the same enthusiasm about making a difference to global refugee crises with handwritten letters, had an amateur logo made in 5 minutes, started a Facebook page and called it the first thing that came into my mind - ‘Letters of Love’.

That’s how it all started!

The ebullient team of 25 peacebuilders from 11 countries, across 7 timezones with an average age of 22 years (our youngest is only 13!) is the fuel on which we run. This inspiring network of young volunteers amaze me at how much of their time, effort and heart they give to Letters of Love despite their own hectic schedules and commitments. “Anything for the kids!” each would exclaim while juggling deadlines. On a personal note,  I do  believe that Letters of Love is as theirs as it is mine.

Today, from being an online initiative, Letters of Love has grown to be a global change movement that offers psychosocial support to refugee children along with a strong emphasis on raising young leaders through empathy-centric education. This quantitative and qualitative growth is solely because each and everyone of the ten thousands who’ve sent their letters believe in its power to bring a smile and instil hope in a refugee child and in their power to make a difference to growing humanitarian crises of our times while raising kind kids in classrooms.

Awareness without action is just information and information in itself is useless. It is what we do with the information that makes all the difference.

You may wonder, ‘Why must one make a difference ?’
Well, it’s simply because -  You can!

I invite you to join us :)

All my heart,
Pooja.
