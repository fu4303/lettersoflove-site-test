  testimonial: Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around.' wrote Leo Buscaglia. I (and my incredible team) took it rather too seriously :)

  bio: Shivani Desai is a self- taught freelance graphic designer based out of Mumbai,
    India and a  graduate in Business Administration. After almost 4 years and 70+
    clients from the design industry, she has her own Brand Strategy and Design Consultancy
    (DeTalks Designs) that aims at elevating the quality of design solutions provided
    to businesses. Her aim is to be able to harness the true power of design and visual
    communication to make an impact on the world and ultimately the humans that reside
    in it. The belief that everyone has the ability to make a ripple of change starting
    within themselves is what makes her commited to Letters of Love and it's mission.
  testimonial: I had signed up for a Peer Couselling Group during my school days.
    They trained us to deal with cases of trauma, abuse and varying levels of mental
    illnesses. Most importantly, they emphasised on how valuable 'communication' and
    'listening' was in this entire exercise. The whole mission was about having a
    physical reminder that love and empathy still existed in the world. There is nothing
    else that's more powerful than a few words of support in the darkest hour. Every
    other shred of support can then be found within. What I learnt then, stuck with
    me for life... so years later, when I heard about Letters of Love, it was hard
    not to be tempted to participate alongside. This is the one place where everyone
    believes in the strength of solidarity, and I wanted to be amongst the few who
    brewed more of it.

  testimonial: |-
    I grew up seeing my parents helping people in any way they could and it’s from the same place that I inculcated the values of helping people to the best of my efforts. It is how the parents are, the same their children become. Because of this whenever I see people in need, I know what is to be done. I saw the dreadful happening in Syria and everybody saw it through their TV’s, newspapers and through social media feed online but everybody sat idle, by believing they are too small to make a significant change.
    It was then that I felt like I should do something for it as refugees are people who have been through a traumatic experience and need to fly away from their homes as soon as possible in order to survive. They have no time to take money, sell properties and plan their travel; everything happens overnight. I understood the pain that they might be suffering from, especially the children for whom suddenly everything changed. Fortunately, after some time I got to know about Letters of Love through a senior of mine. I learned from him that the organisation needed a Graphic Designer. I knew I had to be a part of this organisation anyhow and here I am working for third consecutive year for Letters of Love. For me, if my work even help bring a smile to even one child then it’s satisfying. One child’s smile can change the world and Letters of Love is doing it for many of them. Proud to be a Part of this initiative by Pooja Pradeep.

    also care for those who I care for as well, I feel like I am doing something really
    big that not anyone is doing. This is all because of the help of LOL and all their
    staff. I believe in LOL because it "believes in" love and humanity. Those two
    elements are so important in our lives and so important if we are planning to
    make others smile or enjoy their lives and feel no difference at all. Moreover,
    LOL deals with refugees from different religions, different cultures and different
    regions which means it believes in diversity and this is something I find  attractive
    and inspiring. All what it takes is a letter to draw a smile on others'' faces. '

  testimonial: |-
    “If you have the power to make someone happy, do it. The world needs more of that.”

    A few months ago, my sister and I volunteered with an organization called Refugee Support Europe at the Katsikas camp in Greece, which is home to tens of thousands of refugees including many Syrian, Afghani and Iraqi families. Tens of thousands of refugees who are currently living in makeshift camps, with limited access to essential supplies and resources, uncertain about if and when they will be able to move on and restart their lives.

    Our experience at the camp was a game changer. We realised that refugees are humans and they need to be treated with dignity. When you grant people dignity, they become dignified. While in Greece, we worked tirelessly with the aim to improve the livelihoods and outcomes for these refugees by prioritising dignity and co-operation. Through our volunteering experience, we treated the refugees as the doctors and teachers and craftsmen they once were. Accepting charity is an ugly business for the spirit. It rubs you raw, especially if you were once someone with pride and lofty goals, someone who shook hands and locked eyes. 

    I believe in Letters of Love because it shares a similar mission of spreading smiles to the refugees and infusing a sense of normality and dignity in their lives through hand-written letters. A sense of belongingness, love and care. A feeling that someone out there is thinking and praying for you and that you are not alone.

  bio: "Rukmini is an engineer by education and a digital marketer by profession,
    along with being a doodler in the little time she scoops out in the 24 hours of
    a day. She is driven by anything that inflicts passion in others as well as herself.
    So while she is busy creating masterpieces of work and campaigns for brands making
    them the talk of the town, she also takes care of university and organisation
    partnerships for Letters of Love.\n\n"
  testimonial: '"Start with the smallest things to make the biggest change in the
    world." This is the belief I work with through each day of my life. Work keeps
    me busy, no denying but, when I can still do my bit and make someone smile in
    this world of misery, busy feels like another excuse.'

  age: 24
  location: Massachusetts, United States of America
  bio: Ella is a teacher who loves to learn. She was born and raised in Syracuse,
    New York by parents who are both educators and grew up to value traits like empathy,
    hopefulness as well as the ability to grow and learn from mistakes. She graduated
    from the State University of New York at Cortland's School of Education in 2018
    with a degree in Childhood and Early Childhood Education. Since then, Ella has
    been a district and building substitute teacher in the public school systems of
    Syracuse, New York and Somerville, Massachusetts. Also throughout these last few
    years, Ella has worked as a camp counselor at Seeds of Peace International Summer
    Camp. This camp is in fact where she met and had the lucky pleasure of working
    with Letters of Love founder, Pooja Pradeep! Since then she has been hooked to
    this community of loyal changemakers and digital support systems. She is hopeful
    that this next 2020-2021 school year will bring her the opportunity to teach in
    her own classroom and foster young minds through empathy, hopefulness, as well
    as the ability to grow and learn from mistakes! :)
  testimonial: I always feel somewhat overwhelmed when I’m asked a question like this
    one. At it’s core, I’m drawn to Letters of Love because I am a strong believer
    in the idea that one single person can have a life changing impact on another.
    All too often my phone buzzes with notifications from BBC and CNN, illustrating
    tragedy after tragedy; it’s easy to feel helpless in making a difference when
    the issues are so often advertised as massively hopeless. Letters of Love is a
    bright light in a world that is commonly portrayed as grey. I believe that we
    can spread love and support to people who otherwise may be feeling forgotten,
    reminding them (as well as the rest of the world) that every child, teenager,
    and adult deserves to feel known and, most importantly, feel loved.

  age: 16
  location: Alaska, United States of America
  bio: Gabby Weiss is a passionate seed (Int Session 2019) from the 10th grade, who
    is fascinated by this incredible world and thrives on real connections with people.
    Gabby loves to dance and spend time with her sister. She found Letters of Love
    after she had decided to collect letters for refugees and was searching for a
    place to send them. She searched the web and flooded many inboxes and voice mail
    boxes until she found the LOL founder’s, Pooja's, TEDx Talk. She then reached
    out to her and it changed Gabby’s life. Gabby is a part of Letters of Love because
    she knows there is a 16 year old girl out there, somewhere, just like her, who
    is terrified and whose world is crumbling. Gabby wants her to have hope and feel
    loved.
  testimonial: I believe in LOL because our mission is simple, but can change lives!
    The thing is, every single human being wants to feel loved and supported and valued,
    so LOL collects letters full of love to send to child refugees to show them our
    love and support as well as how valued, important and absolutely incredible they
    are! It is that simple and so important! The other thing about LOL is that we
    are a bunch of passionate people grouped together and nothing will hold us back!
