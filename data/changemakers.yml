  matter: "I care for my family and our world - its people and environment. I believe everyone deserves to have healthy, genuine and nurturing love in their life.I believe in the ability to express one's emotions through art. Being real and raw and honest and authentic with others and ourselves."
  why: "Everyone deserves to know that they are loved and heard, especially in times where one only sees the ugly side of the world. Every child deserves a childhood of peace and nurturing, not torn apart by violence and loss. I felt  hopeless when I found out about the refugee crisis, while I was safely in my warm bed in a house with a loving family. At the same moment there was a girl just like me - two girls for that matter, or 10000s of young girls exactly like me, much younger than me - fearing for their lives and the lives of their family and friends. These are the things that compelled me to join LOL. These are the reasons why we need to help these kids, these human beings, just like us -right...now."

  matter: "My family, my culture and my values matter the most to me. They are the fundamentals of my life. The relationsip I share with others is also very important to me."
  why: "We are living in a very complex world. In this era of transformation, when communication and collaboration has become easier, we have become less concerned about our surroundings. We have become so self centered that we do not care about others’ feelings. There is little difference left between us and robots. Thus, I joined Letters Of Love with the hope of doing whatever little I can, whenever I can and wherever I can. “A journey of thousand miles start with a single step” - its important that we distance ourselves from violence and spread the message of love!"
