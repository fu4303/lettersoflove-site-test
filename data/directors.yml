  passion: 'Bobbie is passionate about community leadership and guidance, and is a deep believer in the youth’s ability to shift the future.
“Letters of Love is a simple concept based on the realization that feeling cherished is the most important ingredient for a healthy childhood. Every child needs to feel cherished to grow into a loving adult. When families become displaced it is often very hard for the children to get the feeling that they are cherished because their parents feel like outcasts. These adults feel left out. They are hurting so much that they have no strength to show how much they cherish their children, commonly. So Letters of Love can help fill that gap. From far away, people who dont even know them, letters are written with care by other children who show them that they are valued. It is a simple idea with big impact!”'
